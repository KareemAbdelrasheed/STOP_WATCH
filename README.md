## Introduction

The Stopwatch project aims to implement a reliable and accurate stopwatch using the TivaC TM4C123GXL microcontroller. It leverages the microcontroller's timer interrupts to ensure precise timing functionality. The project incorporates a reset button to reset the stopwatch to zero and a pause time button to temporarily halt the stopwatch.

## Features

- Accurate stopwatch functionality based on timer interrupts.
- Reset button to set the stopwatch to zero.
- Pause time button to temporarily pause the stopwatch.
- Resume functionality to restart the stopwatch after pausing.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Hardware Requirements

To run the Stopwatch project, the following hardware components are required:

- TivaC TM4C123GXL microcontroller board.
- Push buttons for reset and pause time functionality.
- Appropriate connectors and wiring.

## Software Requirements

The Stopwatch project requires the following software:

- Code Composer Studio (CCS) or any IDE that supports TivaC TM4C123GXL development.
- TivaWareâ„¢ C Series software package for the TivaC TM4C123GXL microcontroller.
- Necessary device drivers and libraries for the IDE.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the Stopwatch project, follow these steps:

1. Connect the TivaC TM4C123GXL microcontroller board to your computer.
2. Install and configure the chosen IDE (e.g., Code Composer Studio).
3. Import the project files into the IDE.
4. Configure the necessary project settings and build options.
5. Connect the push buttons to the microcontroller board according to the specified pin assignments.
6. Ensure all required libraries and device drivers are properly installed and linked.
7. Build the project and flash the microcontroller.

## Usage

Once the Stopwatch project is set up and flashed onto the microcontroller, follow these steps to use the stopwatch:

1. Power on the microcontroller.
2. Observe the stopwatch display indicating "00:00:00" (initial state).
3. Press the reset button to set the stopwatch to zero.
4. Press the start button to start the stopwatch.
5. Press the pause time button to temporarily pause the stopwatch.
6. Press the pause time button again to resume the stopwatch.
7. Press the reset button at any time to reset the stopwatch.
